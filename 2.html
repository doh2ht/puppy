  <h1>Shih Tzu</h1>

  <p>The Shih Tzu is a sturdy little dog with a short muzzle and large dark eyes. They have a soft and long double coat. Although sometimes long, a Shih Tzu will not always have extremely lengthy hair. Some of them have more short, curly hair. This is purely a choice made by the owners. A Shih Tzu should stand no more than 26.7 cm (10Â½ in.) at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4.5 to 7.3 kg (10 to 16 lbs). Drop ears are covered with long fur, and the heavily furred tail is carried curled over the back. The coat may be of any color, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen. The Shih Tzu is slightly longer than tall, and bigger dogs ideally should carry themselves "with distinctly arrogant carriage". A very noticeable feature is the underbite, which is required in the breed standard.</P>
